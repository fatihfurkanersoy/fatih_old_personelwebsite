I am a final year student of bachelor of science in electrical and electronics engineering student at Turkey. 
I am currently working as a Software Engineer in a company that carries out international projects. At the same time, since I am an Electrical and Electronics engineering student, I am also working on hardware. I learned Python in the Python course given by our Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing Community, of which I am the chairman of the board of directors, 3 years ago. My first project at that time was a License Plate Recognition system. I used OCR and OpenCV libraries. Later, I designed an autonomous vehicle that can follow the lane with my friend. I used Jetson Nano as the main processor and CNN as the artificial intelligence model.
Currently, I am a consultant to 14 teams and a captain to 1 team in our YAZGÄ°T Group. We are getting ready for TEKNOFEST, the most important competition in Turkey. We ranked 3rd in Turkey in the Reporting Stage. It has taught me the grow my skills in team collaboration and project leadership.
I have been working as a full-time engineer in an international company for 1 year. I am working in the field of IoT. I develop Temperature Monitoring Systems and customer-based special projects. I develop these projects mainly in Python and C/C++.
